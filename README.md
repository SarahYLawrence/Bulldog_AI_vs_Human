# Java Swing

## Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to see how well AI tools can work to write code using existing frameworks. It's also to test how well a Human can use AI with no prior knowledge of Java Swing. 

## Instructions 
1. Create a sketched out what a Swing-based GUI might look like for the Bulldog program. You should use your AI tool to try to create a program similar to that one. Keeping in mind the agile philosophy of repeated, small releases, i.e. complete usable programs, you should prompt it "in the general direction" of your interface, then get it to work, and finally work on adjusting the user interface to try to match yours.
2. The rules of the game have not changed, but if it helps the development of your UI, you may restrict the game to at most five players (start with two!); the "core engine" of the game should still maintain the ArrayList of Players so that later releases will not be constrained by this change.
3. Try to get the code base to be documented in Javadoc style. 
4. Your "lab book" should include a description of the prompting that you gave the tool. It should also contain an essay with your reactions to how easy or hard it was to implement this project - including whether or not you believe that your knowledge of Swing (which you will need to specify as it varies from student to student) played a role in establishing the difficulty level.  
NOTE: No matter how close you do (or do not) come to making the UI match your sketch, you should include the sketch in your lab book and you should address this issue in your essay. 
5. Your essay should be in the style of a magazine column or a web article for a tech site such as Wired. You needn't worry about a formal introduction but you should lay out the parameters of the discussion. You need not explain the rules of Bulldog or the assignment specifications - but you are certainly welcome to do so if that helps with your exposition. Including (labeled) code snippets to help with exposition is fine, but should probably be limited to areas where surprising results (either good or bad) were found.

# Human Code

## Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to establish some basic code to add on to as we learn about the use of design patterns in object oriented programming and the use of AI tools in software development more generally.

## Instructions 
**Code**  
1. Read Edited_Bulldog.pdf (credit to: Jim Huggins)
2. Create a Java project file in your favorite IDE for the program. The specifications mention that you will be provided with two sample files: Player.java and WimpPlayer.java. Add copies of these files to your project.
3. You are to complete this as you might imagine a student in CS 101 would. Be sure to have clean documentation, but you do not need to use either Javadoc or to mimic the documentation style of the sample code.
**Documentation**  
When your assignment is complete, you are to use the program to play two matches: the first should be between a HumanPlayer and a FifteenPlayer; the second should be between a RandomPlayer and your UniquePlayer. Copy the output from each of these matches into a single text file, separate and label the two transcripts, and include that file with your submissions.

## Provided Files 
Located in the provided filed folder are the follwing:
- Edited_Bulldog.pdf 
- Player.java
- WimpPlayer.java

The goal is to test weather AI can help or harm coding



## Bulldog Game Rules

Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die with the following rules:

- If a 6 is rolled, the turn ends immediately and no points are gained.
- If any other number is rolled, it's added to the turn score.
  - The player can then choose to roll again or end their turn.

- FifteenPlayer:
Objects in the FifteenPlayer class will always choose to continue the turn until a

## Experments:
Program one: tests just the humans skills
Program two: tests the AI skills
Program three: is a comparson between the AI and Human
Program four:The Human with no knowledge using AI to implment Javaswing
Program five: The Human using AI to add improvments to Bulldog
Program six: The Human using AI to implment the Model-View-Controller design pattern
Program seven: The Human using AI to implment the Singleton design pattern
Program eight: The Human using AI to implment the Strategy design pattern

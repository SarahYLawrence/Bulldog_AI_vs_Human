# AI Code

## Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to have the AI repeat the same steps as the Human for later analysis.

## Instructions 
1. Reread Bulldog.pdf. You may, of course, access - and supply to your AI tool - the files Player.java and WimpPlayer.java.
2. Using your AI tool, "write" Bulldog as described in the assignment document. As you do, keep a copy of your session in some format.
3. Once the program is complete - and debugged - demonstrate its correctness by playing a game betwen a FifteenPlayer and a WimpPlayer and add the transcript of that game to your lab write-up.
4. Bring your UniquePlayer from Program1 into this project. This may - or may not - require changes to do so. At the very least, I would expect to require a name change. Keep track of the changes necessary.
5. Play a game betwen a your UniquePlayer and the one written by your AI tool and add the transcript of that game to your lab write-up.
6. Your final write-up should consist of four sections:
  - the transcript from Step 4
  - the transcript from Step 6
  - an edited copy of your "lab book" (see below) to create the code
  - the description of the steps necessary to accomplish Step 5.

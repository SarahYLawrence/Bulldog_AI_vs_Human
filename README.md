## Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is compare program 1: human genrated code to program 2: AI genrated code.

## Instructions 
You are to write an essay (minimum or maximum word counts not specified) discussing YOUR OBESERVATIONS of the differences in programs 1 and 2. Topics which would certainly be worthy of discussion include:    
- Differences in the quality of the output;
- Differences in the time it took to complete the assignment;
- How independent the approaches are, e.g. "even when I used the AI toolm I still had to do ... by hand";
- Differences in the quality of the product, e,g, one approach showed more bugs on the first try;
- Differences in issues of style;
- What might be different if you were to do either assignment again;
- Anything else that you think might be interesting;
  
Your essay should be in the style of a magazine column or a web article for a tech site such as Wired. You needn't worry about a formal introduction but you should lay out the parameters of the discussion. You need not explain the rules of Bulldog or the assignment specifications - but you are certainly welcome to do so if that helps with your exposition. Including (labeled) code snippets to help with exposition is fine, but may not be necessary.

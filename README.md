# Extra

## Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to gprovide a creative outlet for expanding the Bulldog program.

## Instructions 
**Code**
1. Propose a significant new change to the Bulldog program. In this component, you are essentially writing the lab. The work that you propose must be fairly specific and must be related to both the Bulldog game and the ideas of object-oriented design as discussed in the course. Your submission should be in the form of instructions "a la the style of previous assignments." The phrase "a la the style" is meant to imply that your instructions will be complete, but that you are not expected to try to imitate my tone or any other aspects of my writing style. This component is worth five points and partial credit may be given - either because the instructions are too vague or because the chosen task doesn't quite fit.
2. Implement your change. As the header says, implement your proposed change from the previous section. This component is worth seven points and partial credit may be given - ether because the implementation is incomplete or because the task was "too simple."
3. Do it again. Propose and implement a second change. This component is worth seven points and partial credit may be given for any of the previous reasons.

**Documentation**  
There is no "lab book" per se for this lab, but it may be part of what you do. Note that changes are meant to be to the existing code base for the game. Adding new features to the game is not a good extension unless those features require some OOD-based coding and you make that requirement clear in the context of your instructions.

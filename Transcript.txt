3. Lab book:
Name: Chat GBT 
Version: 5.3
Session Date: Feb 1-2
Session goal: Working Bulldog game
Prompt summery: 
    1. First prompt: All of the bulldog instructions. 
        Which was Almost the whole Bulldog.pdf (began at 
        "Background" stoped at "Style Requirements").
    2. Second prompt: solution to error: "cannot access FifteenPlayer". 
    3. Third fourth and fith promps were the same. (ended up just recreating the file)
    4. Sixth prompt: adding WimpPlayer to the switch case (manually added WimpPlayer 
        to the print statment)
Prompting strategy: If there was somthing wrong or not their asked for solution or a fix. 
If it was going in loops I would solve it and keep going.


4. The description of the steps necessary to accomplish Step 5.
Changes in the original Unique:
- Changed file name to UniquePlayerOG. (line 10,12,13,16)
- Changed int total_score = getScore() -> total_score = 0. (line 27)
- Changed return getScore() -> return roll. (line 48)
- NOT NESSARY: changed the print stament on line 67.  
Changes in the AI Unique:
- Adding UniquePlayerOG to the switch case statment in Prog1. (Line 37,38,39)
- NOT NESSARY: added to the print stament to make easyer for users on line 18.
